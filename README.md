# RetroGameStore

Short example of a Retro Game Store site developed with HTML and PHP. This website also utilizes a MySQL database and session variables to manage a shopping cart.

This was developed through the use of XAMPP and written entirely from hand with Notepad++; however, I also have experience in full IDE's such as Aptana Studio, Netbeans, and Dreamweaver.
